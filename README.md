# Road-Section-Time-Series-Prediction

Submitted by - Manmeet Singh Rekhi

## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
Gradient Boosting
Bayesian Ridge
Kernel Ridge
SVR

## Results
The accuracies of the models are as follows:
<ul>Gradient Boosting - 38.077878057313136</ul>
<ul>Bayesian Ridge - 77.04498657347882/ul>
<ul>Kernel Ridge - 106.8198639364674/ul>
<ul>SVR - 75.34074307174144/ul>

# Best Model
Based on the RMSE values obtained, the best model for the time series dataset prediction is Gradient Boosting.
